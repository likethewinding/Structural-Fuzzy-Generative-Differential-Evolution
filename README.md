# SFG-DE: An explainable and evolvable differential evolution for learning to generate operator structures

This repository provides the official MATLAB implementation of Structural Fuzzy Generative Differential Evolution (SFG-DE), a novel variant of Differential Evolution (DE) that learns generating operator structures to enhance adaptive performance.


> 📌 This code is part of our research on enhancing the convergence behavior of Differential Evolution (DE) using a structural fuzzy generative strategy, an estimation of univariate Gaussian distribution strategy, and a Metropolis criterion and individual regeneration selection strategy. We developed SFG-DE based on a fundamentally different design philosophy, in contrast to the JADE/SHADE/L-SHADE family, which represents the mainstream DE research.
