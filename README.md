# SFG-DE: Structural-Fuzzy-Generative Differential Evolution

This repository provides the official MATLAB implementation of SFG-DE, a novel variant of Differential Evolution (DE) that learns generating operator structures to enhance adaptive performance.


> 📌 This code was developed as part of our research work on enhancing the convergence behavior of DE using structural and fuzzy generative strategies.
